    # A description for the paper.
    description: The radioactive element astatine exists only in trace amounts in nature. Its properties can therefore only be explored by study of the minute quantities of artificially produced isotopes or by performing theoretical calculations. One of the most important properties influencing the chemical behaviour is the energy required to remove one electron from the valence shell, referred to as the ionization potential.

# Bio

I am a Full Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University. I am the Editor-in-Chief of [IEEE Transaction on Visualization and Computer Graphics](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tg). Starting from August 2024, I rotated to [NSF IIS Human Center Computing cluster](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/hcc-iis-human-centered-computing) as a program director. In 2024, I received [the IEEE VGTC Technical Achievement Award](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/awards/visualization-technical-awards/) for my research on visualization. I am also an inductee of [IEEE Visualization Academy](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/awards/visualization-academy/). I lead the Graphics and Visualization Study (GRAVITY) research group. Our research interests include data analysis and visualization, machine learning, computer graphics, and high performance computing. I joined Ohio State in 1999. Before that, I worked at NASA Ames Research Center from 1996 to 1999. I received my Ph.D from the Scientific Computing and Imaging Group at University of Utah in 1998, MS from State University of New York at Stony Brook, and BS from National Taiwan University.

Check this [*link*](https://sites.google.com/view/gravity-research-group/people) if you want to get in touch with my students and GRAVITY Alumni, and I am constantly looking for new talented students!
