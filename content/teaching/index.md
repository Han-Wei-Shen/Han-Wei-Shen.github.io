## Other Courses

Teaching is one of the most enjoyable things for me at Ohio State. In the past, I mainly taught courses related to computer graphics and visualization. Occasionally, I taught other related courses such as numerical methods.  Below is a list of courses that I have taught at the Ohio State. Detailed information can be found by following the links.
